# Running selenium
## First

- Add account `seed` and `address` either in `tests/frontend selenium/Config.ini` or by exporting `SELENIUM_SEED` and `SELENIUM_ADDRESS`.
## Second
- You need to leave the server running and open new terminal.
- Change direcotry to frontend selenium through the command line using `cd tests/frontend_selenium`
- You can run selenium with pytest through the command line using  `python3 -m pytest -v`
### More options to run tests
- You can also run single test file through the command line using `python3 -m pytest tests/test_file.py`
- You can also run specific test case through the command line using `python3 -m pytest tests/test_file.py::test_func` 
- You can also run collection of test cases through the command line using `python3 -m pytest -v -k 'test_func or test_func'` 
- You can also run all the tests and get an HTML report using [pytest-html](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-html/) package through the command line using `python3 -m pytest -v --html=report.html`
